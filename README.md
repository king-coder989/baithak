# 🪶 Baithak — A Decentralized Space for AI Creators

**Tagline:** _AI ki Baithak — where models meet chai._

Baithak is a decentralized platform for AI creators to **store, share, and collaborate** on datasets, models, prompts, and configuration files — all powered by **Filecoin** and **Lighthouse**.  
Think of it as the decentralized, community-first version of Hugging Face — where your AI assets stay **secure, permanent, and truly yours.**

## 🚀 Project Vision

AI innovation thrives on open sharing — but centralized storage means limited control, privacy risks, and impermanence.  
**Baithak** flips that script: a decentralized hub where creators own their uploads, control access, and collaborate without gatekeepers.

> A digital baithak for AI minds — decentralized, secure, and built for the future of open AI.
